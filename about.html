                    <h3>My Story</h3>

                    <p>I am a hard working, solution-oriented, adaptable and optimistic Honours  Graduate from the University of Limpopo with a strong desire to pursue a career in a Computer Science Industry. I am currently enrolled for Master of Science in the field of e-Science at the University of the Witwatersrand, I am majoring in Data Science. My research is on sentiment analysis of student textual feedback to improve teaching and learning. </p>

                    <p>The relevant modules in my Masterâ€™s degree include Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning, Statistical Foundations  of  Data Science, Data Visualisation and Exploration, Large Scale Optimisation for Data Science, Data Privacy and Ethics, and Research Methods and Capstone Project in Data Science. I decided to study Data Science because I have a passion for solving  problems, therefore, having heard and researched about Data Science, I found that this field can help one to create better solutions for real world problems that people face today.</p>
                    
                    <p>I possess a multitude of skills that I have acquiredfrom past training and academic experience that have allowed me to develop actionable solutions for  team projects. The skills include but not limited to communication,  collaboration, problem-solving, adaptability, and time management skills. I  have a desire to continue learning and acquire more knowledge and skills so  that I can stay relevant and be able to solve problems in this rapidly  changing world, where needs and problems change every day. </p>
